# Reference: Delegating Phases to Subagents

**Research, verification and review always run in a subagent; non-trivial design and planning
default to fresh-context subagents with an inline fallback when unavailable. Parallel implementation
is capability- and independence-gated.** Two reasons, and both are decisive for the
mandatory three:

1. **Independence** — a dedicated agent with one sharply-scoped job, fresh context, no accumulated
   drift. A reviewer or verifier that shares the implementer's context inherits its blind spots.
2. **Context economy** — research is the most token-expensive phase in the run: it reads dozens
   of files to produce a concise evidence handoff. Done in the main context, it burns the window on raw file
   contents *before implementation starts* — the phase that actually needs the room. Delegated,
   the main agent receives the relevant findings instead of the fifty files.

**Spend the context where the work is.**

## Capability ladder

**Research, verification (Phase 5) and review (Phase 6) are always run in a subagent — no
inline fallback.** Their whole value is independence and a fresh context: a research agent that
shares the implementer's context inherits its blind spots, and a reviewer that grades in the
same session cannot un-see the reasoning it is meant to catch. If the harness genuinely cannot
spawn a subagent, that is a **blocker** — record it in `state.md` and stop per prime directive 8;
do not silently fold these phases into the main context.

For the **other** delegated phases (design, planning, and any parallel implementation), degrade
gracefully:

1. Subagent with **fresh context** (preferred).
2. No subagent support → do the phase **inline**, in the main context, to the same standard and
   the same artifact. Note it in `state.md`; expect less room later, so keep increments smaller.

## Rules that make delegation safe

- **Artifacts must reach disk.** With scoped artifact-write permission, the subagent writes
  its assigned output and the parent reads it. Otherwise return the complete artifact for the
  parent to persist unchanged and verify before advancing; chat alone is not a durable handoff.
  Keep review judgments separate from the parent's dispositions. Never bypass withheld writes
  through a shell. When persistence is complete, the reply can be a short summary plus the path.
- **Resolve the path before believing the summary.** A subagent can report a file it did not
  write where it says it did — sandboxes and shells resolve relative and `/tmp`-style paths
  differently, so the write lands somewhere else and the summary still reads as success. `ls`
  the exact path first. No file, no gate: locate it or re-run.
- **Spot-check before trusting.** The parent samples **three citations at random** and resolves
  them against the source. Any miss → reject and re-run. Delegation moves the reading out of the
  parent's context, so an invented citation is invisible unless it is checked.
- **Grounding still binds the implementer.** The document is an index into the code, not a
  replacement for it. Re-open a file before editing it.
- **One writer, least privilege.** Research/design/planning/review agents never edit
  implementation source. Scope writes to assigned `.ai/<slug>/` artifacts when supported;
  otherwise withhold writes and use parent persistence above. Inspection commands must also be
  read-only over source; do not treat a shell as a workaround for withheld edit tools.
- **Bound it.** Give the subagent a timeout and a scope; if it fails or hangs, record the
  blocker rather than re-running it a third time. Inline fallback applies only to optional
  delegation; mandatory research, verification and review remain blocked.

## Which phases

### Current-contract and admission context

For an adopted task, every brief below includes the resolved `current-design.json` revision,
retained document/contract paths and hashes, registered action/check IDs, current `status`
blockers and exact evidence destinations. Use [workflow-gates.md](workflow-gates.md);
do not send only historical `design.html` or the parent's optimistic summary.
For an admitted null-command check, pass the original run ID, inputs and prerequisite
receipt references. The host launches the actual fresh agent; `next` only returns the
handoff. `record` retains the registered producer, with separate recorder attribution.

Initial research/design/review/planning precede adoption and use the ordinary briefs without
invented admissions. Later guarded operations do not retroactively convert that work into
execution proof. Mandatory fresh researcher/verifier/reviewer roles remain; self-declared
context strings are not authentication or evidence of host isolation. If the host cannot
provide the required fresh role, report the blocker rather than rename self-review.

| Phase | Delegate | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **1 — Research** | **Required — always a subagent** | Independence + biggest context win; read-heavy, output small. Read-only. |
| **2 — Design** | **Yes, by default** (inline fallback allowed) | Quality-critical artifact; benefits from fresh eyes and a single job. |
| **2b — Design review** | **Yes** (prefer a different model; read-only) | Cheapest defect-catch; grades the design before the human sees it. See below. |
| **3 — Plan** | **Yes, by default** for non-trivial work (inline fallback when unavailable) | Fresh-context planner derives tasks/checks per `planning.md`; parent owns readiness, ordering and Gate 3. |
| **4 — Implement** | Only for genuinely parallel work | See `parallel-execution.md`. |
| **5 — Verify (E2E)** | **Required — always a subagent** | Independent proof; the agent that exercises the feature is not the one that built it. Read + execute + test-authoring. See below. |
| **6 — Review** | **Required — always a subagent** | Independence is the point; prefer a different model, tools scoped read-only. See `review-and-pr.md`. |

## Brief: research

> **ROLE.** You are the Research Agent, and you are **READ-ONLY** for this phase: you may read,
> search and run read-only inspection commands, but you must not edit any source file.
>
> **OBJECTIVE.** Produce `.ai/<slug>/research.md` describing **what exists today** that bears on
> this requirement: `<requirement>`.
>
> **INPUTS.** Supply the complete requirement, stable ACs, decisions/exclusions, bounded
> assignment, repository/worktree, and accessible paths to the workspace records and
> `references/research.md`. That reference is the procedure, never the task-output destination.
>
> **PROCESS.** Read the repository's own agent instructions first (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
> `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.cursor/rules`, path-specific files) and honor them. Then
> trace the code the requirement touches and its callers, the contracts and shared types it is
> constrained by, the conventions this codebase actually uses, the tests already covering the
> area, the seams the new work attaches to, and the **blast radius**. Search broad first; do not
> stop at the first plausible file.
>
> **EVIDENCE POLICY.** Every claim about the codebase carries `path:line` and the snippet it
> rests on — **no citation, no claim**. Every "not implemented" carries the search that came up
> empty, with its scope. **Type every material claim** FACT / INFERENCE / HYPOTHESIS / UNKNOWN;
> never infer behaviour from a name. Head the file with the commit sha, branch, date,
> dirty-tree context and scope. A zero-match search establishes only a scoped not-found result.
>
> **STOP CONDITIONS.** If a fact a decision will depend on cannot be established, mark it
> **UNKNOWN** and record it — do **not** fill the gap with a plausible guess. Do **not** propose
> a solution, an approach, or a file layout; that is the design's job. Do **not** edit source.
>
> **OUTPUT CONTRACT.** Write `.ai/<slug>/research.md` using the full output contract in
> `references/research.md`: AC coverage, behavior/failure traces, contracts/consumers, reuse
> examples and actual tests, historical/version context, scoped gaps, and typed unknowns.
> Keep the summary concise without dropping requirement-relevant evidence. If artifact writes
> are withheld, return the full report for the parent to persist and verify before the gate.
> Reply with a five-line summary, the output location, and unresolved parent actions.
>
> **COMPLETION GATE.** Every material requirement has at least one verified FACT or is explicitly
> marked UNKNOWN; nothing unverified is stated as fact.

## Brief: design

> **ROLE.** You are the Design Agent. You may read and search; you must not write or modify any
> implementation code — you create only `.ai/<slug>/design.html`.
>
> **OBJECTIVE.** Read `.ai/<slug>/research.md` and `.ai/<slug>/state.md`, then design the program
> before it is written, so it fits the existing architecture and can be built incrementally.
>
> **PROCESS / OUTPUT CONTRACT.** Produce `.ai/<slug>/design.html` per `references/design-doc.md`
> and `references/html-theme.md`: the classes/modules, interfaces and public method signatures to
> add or change, each with its single responsibility and collaborators; the key interactions as a
> simple sequence diagram; data and contracts; decisions with rejected alternatives; failure
> modes. **Include the as-is → to-be table** — for every symbol you change, its current behaviour
> *citing research* and what it becomes. Prefer existing patterns; introduce a named pattern only
> where it solves a real problem; keep the design proportional.
>
> **EVIDENCE POLICY.** Every existing symbol you name must appear in the research document or be
> one you have opened and read yourself — mark anything unverified as such, never as an existing
> API. Every acceptance criterion must map to a named component or method.
>
> **STOP CONDITIONS.** If research is missing a fact the design needs, stop and report it rather
> than inventing behaviour. Plain semantic HTML only, ≤3 printed pages, simple diagrams (≤7
> boxes, one level). Do not write implementation code. Reply with a five-line summary and the
> path.

## Brief: design review (Gate 2b)

> **ROLE.** You are the Design Review Agent, an independent reviewer in a **fresh context** — you
> did not write this design. You are **read-only**: you may read the design, the research and the
> source, but you write only `.ai/<slug>/design-review.md`. Do not rewrite the design; report.
>
> **INPUTS.** `.ai/<slug>/design.html`, `.ai/<slug>/research.md`, and the acceptance criteria.
>
> **PROCESS.** Grade the design against the checklist in `references/project-profile.md`:
> **requirement coverage** (every AC maps to a named component; nothing asked-for is missing);
> **SOLID / cohesion / coupling**; **right-sized pattern** — flag both over-engineering
> (components/abstractions tagged to no requirement, patterns with no problem) *and*
> under-structure (a god-object, a missing seam); **interface quality** (minimal, clear, correct
> signatures); **error/edge/failure handling**; **testability**; **security & performance**;
> and **grounding** — every existing symbol the design names must be real (cite research or the
> source). Check that each component's `Why (AC)` and `Principle` tags actually hold. Also judge
> **readability**: plain language a newcomer can follow, diagrams that carry the structure, and
> the whole thing skimmable in five minutes — flag dense prose, undefined jargon, or a missing
> required diagram.
>
> **OUTPUT CONTRACT.** Write `.ai/<slug>/design-review.md`: a findings table (finding · severity
> · which principle/AC · suggested direction) and a one-word verdict — **APPROVE / REVISE /
> REJECT**. REJECT if a requirement is uncovered or a named symbol does not exist. Reply with a
> five-line summary and the path.
>
> **STOP CONDITIONS.** Do not propose a full redesign or write code; surface the gap and let the
> owner decide. Judge the design on its merits, not against how you would have written it.

## Planning and consumer readiness (Phase 3)

Delegate non-trivial planning to a fresh-context subagent by default. Supply `planning.md`
and its filled-in brief with the accepted research,
approved design, requirement/ACs, current workspace and explicit output paths. The planner writes
only the assigned plan/task artifacts; it does not redesign or implement.

Before Gate 3, the parent runs the bounded consumer-readiness check in `planning.md`, walking
a ready task and a relevant dependency/failure boundary using the linked artifacts. Record
READY / REVISE / BLOCKED with missing inputs/instructions; repair the artifacts, not just the
conversation. The parent owns full coverage reconciliation and resolving findings.
The incoming implementer confirms its task handoff before editing. Reserve an additional
independent plan reviewer for high-risk work or complex dependencies, not every plan.
If planning delegation is unavailable, record the inline fallback in `state.md`; trivial work
keeps its short path. Existing mandatory research, design-review, verification and review
requirements are unchanged.

## Brief: verify (Phase 5 end-to-end)

> **ROLE.** You are the Verification Agent, running in a **fresh context** — you did not build
> this feature. Your job is to prove it works the way a real user or client would exercise it,
> and to leave that proof behind as committed tests and captured evidence. You may read,
> search, run the system and its tests, and **author end-to-end/integration tests** — but you do
> not modify production code; if a test can only pass by changing product behaviour, that is a
> finding, not a fix.
>
> **INPUTS.** The requirement and acceptance criteria, `design.html`, `plan.html` and its linked
> task/check records, `traceability.md`, and the current working tree (implementation complete).
>
> **PROCESS.** Map each acceptance-criterion scenario to existing coverage first; add tests only
> for the uncovered ones, extending the existing suite. Exercise the real public surface with the
> system actually running — **all browser/front-end verification uses `agent-browser`** (see
> `references/e2e-agent-browser.md`); non-browser surfaces per `references/testing-and-e2e.md`.
> Record exact commands, exit codes and results. Reconcile planned checks with the actual
> scenarios they assert; use the assigned evidence paths. Do not confirm human-owned acceptance
> on the human's behalf or treat planned/unexecuted checks as passing.
> At an intermediate increment, verify its due scenarios and affected prior regressions, leaving
> future tasks explicitly planned. At final ship, reconcile every AC, including spanning ACs.
>
> **OUTPUT CONTRACT.** Capture evidence into `.ai/<slug>/evidence/` (commands, output,
> screenshots, console/errors, one pass/fail line per criterion) and fill the `Test` and
> `Evidence` columns of `traceability.md`. Reply with a five-line summary and the paths.
>
> **STOP CONDITIONS.** If the environment makes real end-to-end proof impossible (no network,
> credentials or runnable host), do **not** weaken the gate or fake a pass: verify at the deepest
> level the environment allows, name the blocker, list the criteria left environment-unverified,
> and give the exact command a human can run to finish the proof.

## Handoff back

The parent, on receiving either document: read the file, run the spot-check, record the outcome
in `state.md`, then continue the loop. For design, the parent — not the subagent — presents it
to the user and stops for sign-off (Gate 2).
