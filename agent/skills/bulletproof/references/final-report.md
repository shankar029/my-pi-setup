# Reference: The Final Report

Every run ends with one, written to `.ai/<slug>/report.html` and summarised in the chat. It is
the artifact a person opens to answer three questions: **what do I have, can I trust it, and
what is left?**

Use the shared theme exactly as the design document does (`html-theme.md`) — plain semantic
HTML, no styling in the file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../assets/artifact.css">
<script src="../assets/artifact.js" defer data-doc="report.html" data-slug="<slug>"></script>
```

The review layer applies here too: the reader can highlight, comment and return a verdict on
the report itself.

## Rules

- **Report what is true, not what was hoped.** A gate that did not pass is `⛔` with the
  reason, never a ✅ with a caveat buried in prose.
- **Every number is regenerated at the final commit**, never copied from an earlier run.
- **Anything unproven gets the exact command to finish it.** "Not verified" without a next
  step is an unfinished report.
- **Write it even when the run is cut short.** A partial report that names the blocker is worth
  far more than none — if you are interrupted, this is the file that saves the work.
- Keep it to about two pages. It is a status document, not a narrative.
- For adopted work, resolve the current design and derive runtime readiness/blockers from
  actual `status` per [workflow-gates.md](workflow-gates.md), with the observation's input
  binding. The report and `state.md` are indexes, not another ledger. Before adoption,
  label gate evidence procedural instead of inventing guarded status.
- Separate ready/executed/accepted/closed and local preservation from release. Keep
  unavailable metric attachment/positive closure, recovery, unconfirmed human approval
  and host/publication limitations visible. Historical test/coverage/evaluation figures
  retain their original scope and date; they are not current root quality measurements.

## Structure

| Section | Contents |
|---|---|
| **1. Outcome** | One paragraph: what now works that did not before, and the headline caveat if there is one. State the branch and whether a PR exists. |
| **2. Delivered / not delivered** | Two short lists. Anything asked for but not built belongs in the second one, with why. |
| **3. Acceptance criteria** | Table: AC · verdict (VERIFIED / VERIFIED-WITH-LIMITATIONS / NOT-VERIFIED / BLOCKED, from `traceability.md`) · **how it was proven** (which test, which transcript, which artifact). An AC with no proof is not VERIFIED. |
| **4. Gates** | The G1–G6 row with `✅ / ⛔ / ⬜` and a reason for anything not green. This is the fastest read of run health. |
| **5. Measurements** | Tests (count, pass/fail), coverage, probe deltas vs the merge-base, mutation score with survivors, current run/source binding, measured status **and** completeness. List missing required proof and prerequisites; incomplete is fail, never a green quality gate. |
| **6. Scorecard** | The 9 rubric dimensions, each with a score and a one-line justification **citing a number** where one exists (`quality-bar.md`). Include the convergence iteration count. |
| **7. Pending & unproven** | What is environment-blocked, skipped or deferred — each with the command or decision needed to close it. |
| **8. Assumptions** | Every default taken without confirmation, especially an unapproved design, flagged for the reader to confirm. |
| **9. Follow-ups** | Work deliberately left out of scope, sized and justified. |
| **10. How to finish** | The literal next commands: push, open the PR, re-run a blocked check. |

## The chat summary

Follow `communication.md`: lead with the delivered outcome or plainly state incomplete delivery.
Mirror the required status in a few lines: gate row, headline numbers, material limitations and
pending work, and the path to `report.html`. Do not paste the whole report into the chat — link it.
Do not omit a failure or invent a cause to keep the summary short. Give a human next action only
when one is necessary; otherwise stop. The presentation rules never reduce the full report's
evidence or required contents.
