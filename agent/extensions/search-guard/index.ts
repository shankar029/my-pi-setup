/**
 * Search Guard
 *
 * Blocks pathological repo-wide shell searches before they run and tells the model
 * what to use instead.
 *
 * Why this exists: a subagent researching this repo issued
 *
 *     grep -rn "he-vs-assign-panel" --include=* -l . | grep -v node_modules
 *
 * which scans every file in the tree (the `grep -v` filter runs far too late) including a
 * committed 29MB installer. It never returned. The per-tool deadline fired at 300s and the
 * whole research run was lost. Measured alternatives on the same query:
 *
 *     grep -r ...            > 300s (killed)
 *     rg (default)             32.2s
 *     rg -t cs -t ts -t js      1.0s
 *     rg <subtree>              0.3s
 *     grep tool (fff)         instant
 *
 * Prompt rules did not prevent this: that agent had a working `grep` tool, used it
 * successfully, and then shelled out to `grep -r` anyway. So this is a hard block, not advice.
 *
 * Escape hatch: append `#allow-slow-search` to the command when a full scan is genuinely
 * intended (e.g. searching ignored or binary files).
